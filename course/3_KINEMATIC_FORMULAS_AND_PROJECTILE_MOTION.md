# Kinematic formulas and projectile motion

## Final velocity with constant acceleration with change in time

$\vec{v_f} = \vec{v_i} + \vec{a_c}\Delta t$

- $\vec{v_f}$ is final velocity
- $\vec{v_i}$ is initial velocity
- $\vec{a_c}$ is constant acceleration
- $\Delta t$ is change in time

## Final distance with constant acceleration with change in time

If we draw on the coordiante axis the velocity change over time (x axis - time, y axis - velocity), then the distance will be the area from the velocity slope to the x axis.

$\vec{s} = \vec{v_a} \Delta t = \frac{\Delta t(\vec{v_i} + \vec{v_f})}{2}$

- $\vec{s}$ is displacement
- $\vec{v_a}$ is average velocity
