# Vectors and Scalars

## Scalars

Scalars has only a **magnitude** (size)

When we are talking about how far are we moving things as a scalar value, we call it a **distance**.

When we are moving things with scalar value, we call it a **speed**.

## Vectors

Vectors has a **magnitude** (size) and **direction** [magnitude, direction]

When we are moving things with vectors, we call it a **velocity**.

When we are talking about how far are we moving things as a vector, we call it a **displacement**.

## Displacement

Displacement is defined to be the change in position of an object.

Displacement $= \Delta x = x_f - x_0$

$\Delta x$ is the symbol used to represent displacement.
$x_f$ refers to the value of the final position.
$x_0$ refers to the value of the initial position.
