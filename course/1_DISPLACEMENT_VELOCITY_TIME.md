# Vectors and Scalars

## Scalars

Scalars has only a **magnitude** (size)

When we are talking about how far are we moving things as a scalar value, we call it a **distance**.

When we are moving things with scalar value, we call it a **speed**.

## Vectors

Vectors has a **magnitude** (size) and **direction** [magnitude, direction]

When we are moving things with vectors, we call it a **velocity**.

When we are talking about how far are we moving things as a vector, we call it a **displacement**.

## Displacement

Displacement is defined to be the change in position of an object.

Displacement $= \Delta x = x_f - x_0$

- $\Delta x$ is the symbol used to represent displacement.
- $x_f$ refers to the value of the final position.
- $x_0$ refers to the value of the initial position.

## Speed (Rate)

Speed is scalar value that reperesent how fast things moved.

$r = \frac{d}{t}$

- $r$ is rate (speed)
- $d$ is distance
- $t$ is time

## Velocity

Velocity is a vector that represents a magnitude and direction.

$\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{s}}{t}$

- $\vec{v}$ is **velocity**
- $\vec{s}$ is a **displacement**
- $t$ is **time**

## Time

Time is a scalar value that represents a time.

**Scalar formula:**

$t = \frac{d}{r}$

- $t$ is **time**
- $d$ is a **distance**
- $r$ is **rate**

**OR**

**Vector formula:**

$t = \frac{\vec{s}}{\vec{v}}$

- $t$ is **time**
- $\vec{s}$ is a **displacement**
- $\vec{v}$ is **velocity**

## Instantaneous speed

**Instantaneous speed** - speed at a particular moment in time. Or it's the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.

**Instantaneous velocity** - a velocity at a particular moment in time. Simply is is the average velocity at a specific instant in time or over an infinitesimally small time interval. Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity $v$ at a precise instant time $t$ can involve taking a limit, a calculus operation.

$v_{instantaneous} = v_{average} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_f - x_0}{t_f - t_0}$

- $v_{instantaneous}$ is **instantaneous velocity**
- $v_{average}$ is **average velocity**
- $\Delta x$ is **change in position** (displacement)
- $\Delta t$ is **change in time**
- $x_f$ is final position
- $x_0$ is beginning position
- $t_f$ is final time
- $t_0$ is beginning time

## SI System

- $r$ - $m$ (meters)
- $d$ - $m$ (meters)
- $t$ - $s$ (seconds)
- $v$ - $\frac{m}{s}$ (meters per second)
